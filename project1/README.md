# Project #1
## Project Description :
This Node.js Express application serves as a secure journal platform for users to manage their notes. Leveraging SQLite for database operations and Auth0 for user authentication, the program efficiently allows users to record, update, and retrieve personal notes. The app, divided into modules for specific tasks, includes an initial data seeding file. Its design was pre-planned, considering key functionalities, database schema, route definitions, and security aspects. The final application, offering authenticated access to personal notes, also provides an additional route for future enhancement.



### A STAR Review:



#### Situation: 

The need was to create a secure, user-friendly journal application. We designed this application to enable users to record, update, and retrieve personal notes efficiently. The existing system lacked robust user authentication, and the organization of routes needed improvement for better maintainability and scalability.

#### Task: 

My task was to design and implement this journal application, which involved several key elements. These included setting up the server, establishing the database connections, defining the routes and responses, implementing user authentication, and ensuring secure access to the app. I also needed to ensure the app was deployed successfully and functioned as expected in the live environment.

#### Action: 

I utilized Node.js and Express for server setup and route definition, Sequelize ORM for database operations, and SQLite for storage. I have achieved user authentication through Auth0 and OpenID Connect while using dotenv for environment variable configuration. I organized the code into separate modules, each responsible for a specific task. I created software designs representing the application structure and implemented route handlers for each endpoint. Once the app was ready, I thoroughly tested it in a local environment before deploying it on a server.

#### Result: 

The result was a secure, user-friendly journal application that efficiently allowed users to manage their notes. The implemented user authentication ensured secure access to the app. The improved route organization made the app more manageable and scalable. The successful application deployment provided a reliable user experience, and the project enhanced my skills in analyzing user problems, creating effective software designs, and translating these designs into a functional application.

#### Node.js & Express
#### Sequelize & SQLite
#### Auth0 & OpenID Connect
#### dotenv
### Competencies
#### JOB FUNCTION 2:3 Can develop effective user interfaces
I had to conceptualize a secure and user-friendly journal application as part of my project. It required a deep understanding of user requirements and translating those into a simple yet efficient application.

#### JF 2.4: Can create simple software designs to communicate the understanding of the program effectively
I aimed to create a software design that effectively communicates the journal application's structure. I made the application blueprint using software design tools, including the server setup, database connections, routes, and data seeding operations. This approach helped me map out the application's various components, enhancing the system's overall understanding.

#### JF 2.6: Can translate wireframes into User Interfaces
Though this project was primarily back-end focused, I still had to visualize how the endpoints would interact with potential front-end interfaces. I created mockups of how the users might utilize endpoints in a user interface, such as forms for creating and editing journal entries and list views for displaying them. These allowed me to design the API with the final user interface in mind.

#### JOB FUNCTION 4:
I managed and deployed the journal application, conducted testing, and ensured it adhered to industry security standards.

#### JF 4.3:
Leveraging Node.js capabilities, I successfully managed and deployed the code into the development environment. I provided a secure and reliable user experience by enforcing secure practices and standards.

#### Describe a situation where you demonstrated this job function:
I was responsible for deploying the journal application, ensuring it was secure and functional in the live environment.

#### Summarize the actions you took to accomplish the goal:
To accomplish this, I first audited the application for potential security risks, implementing necessary protection measures. I then tested the application thoroughly in a local environment before deploying it. Upon ensuring everything worked as expected, I deployed the application on a server.

#### Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning:
As a result, the application was successfully deployed and securely available for use. This process has reinforced my skills in managing and deploying applications, conducting thorough testing, and adhering to industry security standards.
