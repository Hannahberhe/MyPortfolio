Project Description
"The Amazing Characters of Disney" is an application that allows users to explore the amazing world of Disney characters. This project fetches data from an external API and presents it in a user-friendly interface built using React.js. This application gives Disney fans access to detailed information about their favorite characters, including their appearances in TV shows, films, short films, and video games.
## A STAR Review
## Situation
My team and I  creatied a project called "The Amazing Characters of Disney." We were to develop a platform to showcase the rich and diverse range of characters from Disney's history, from their early days to the present. 
### Our tech stack 
involved React for the front end, Express, jsonwebtoken, @hapi/joi, bcrypt, and mongoose for the back end, MongoDB as our database, and Railway and Render for deploying our backend and frontend respectively.
### Task
My role was to contribute effectively within the team, adhere to our approach towards continuous integration, version control, create and analyze user stories, maintain a logical and maintainable codebase, implement authentication and authorization to the API, ensure encryption of sensitive user data, deploy code, and ensure compliance with design, security, and maintainability requirements.
### Action
Working in close collaboration with another developer, we programmed in pairs, collectively deciding on code implementations and tackling bugs. We effectively utilized industry-standard tools, such as GitHub Actions, GitHub, and Git, for continuous integration and version control.
Understanding our user base was a crucial aspect of the project. As such, we developed use cases and user stories that revolved around diverse Disney character fans, ensuring we catered to the most common and extreme user scenarios.
In maintaining a logical and secure codebase, I took the lead in implementing functions and logic behind features like user login, logout, and registration, along with profile features. With the use of bcrypt, we ensured sensitive data like user passwords were hashed and encrypted.
We implemented a robust authentication and authorization system that used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to generate and expire access and refresh tokens as required. In terms of deployment, I led the team in writing GitHub Actions workflows, and also took responsibility for configuring Render and Railway for our frontend and backend deployments respectively.
Throughout the project, I applied structured techniques for problem-solving, including debugging and code issue identification. Despite the challenges encountered, I remained motivated, demonstrating a disciplined and responsible approach to risk.
Result
Our team successfully built a platform that authentically showcased the amazing characters of Disney, providing a secure and engaging experience for users. Notable problems were solved with initiative, such as a critical deployment issue where I replaced Redis with MongoDB in our codebase due to persistent deployment problems.
The project enhanced my technical skills and highlighted the significance of effective teamwork, problem-solving, and time management for project success. It also cemented my ability to handle responsibilities independently and stay committed and motivated even when faced with challenges. The satisfaction of delivering a project that resonated with Disney fans made the experience truly rewarding.
### Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project's root directory and run npm install to install all the dependencies.
Start the project using the command npm start. The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Features
##### Browse Characters: 
Users can browse through a comprehensive list of Disney characters.
##### Character Details:
Clicking on a character opens a detailed view, displaying more information about the character, such as the TV shows, films, short films, and video games in which they have appeared.
##### Favorites: 
Users can mark their favorite characters, creating a personalized collection to revisit later.
##### Contributions
I had the pleasure of contributing significantly to this project. Here are some of the contributions I made:
Project Name Change: I changed the project's name to be more reflective of its functionality - from "Find a Friend" to "The Amazing Characters of Disney". The changes were made in the package.json file.
##### Data Display:
I updated the UserDetails component to include lists of TV shows, films, short films, and video games the character has been a part of. This was done to provide users with more comprehensive information about each character.
##### Styling:
I made significant changes to the CSS to enhance the application's aesthetics. This included changes to the backdrop filters, margins, font sizes, and more.

##### JF 1.5 can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software 

During the development of "The Amazing Characters of Disney" project, I found myself working alongside a team of dedicated developers. We were tasked with creating an interactive web application that showcased the wide array of Disney characters, their stories, and their characteristics. As part of the team, I was responsible for front-end development using React and Tailwind CSS.
The team operated in a collaborative setting where we often pair programmed, bouncing ideas off of each other to enhance the user interface and overall user experience. We shared the workload effectively, contributing ideas, solving problems, and ensuring that every line of code written was meaningful and efficient.
Our collaboration resulted in an interactive and visually appealing application that Disney fans of all ages enjoyed. My understanding and ability to work in a team to produce software were essential in driving the success of this project.

## JF 2.2: Can identify relevant and up-to-date software designs and how to read and implement functional/technical specifications

To build the Disney project, staying updated with the latest software design patterns was necessary. I ensured that our application adhered to current best practices, such as component-based architecture and RESTful APIs. Furthermore, I effectively interpreted the project's functional and technical specifications, implementing them accurately in the application.

## JF 2.3: Can develop effective user interfaces

In the Disney project, I designed and developed an engaging and interactive user interface displaying various Disney characters and their details. The interface was intuitive, allowing users to navigate through the application seamlessly. It was built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring accessibility on various devices.
